# RAG_RHLF_project
This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that answers user queries by combining information retrieved from web content (an IBM machine learning article) and a PDF document. It uses LangChain with ChromaDB for document retrieval, Ollama as the language model for generating responses, and a DistilBERT-based reward model to score the quality of the answers. The system maintains conversation history for context, stores user feedback in an SQLite database, and allows users to rate each response, enabling continuous improvement and potential fine-tuning of the reward model.
